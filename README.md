🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js ≥ 20.19 (recommended)

npm ≥ 10

Install & Run
bash
Copy code
# install
npm install

# dev
npm run dev

# build & start
npm run build
npm start

# lint / format (optional)
npm run lint
npm run format
Visit http://localhost:3000.

🔐 Environment Variables
Create a .env.local in the repo root:

bash
Copy code
# Site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Resend (email)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Contact settings
EMAIL_TO=you@example.com
EMAIL_FROM="Portfolio Contact <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
Resend note: Free accounts can only send to your own address until you verify a domain.
To email other recipients:

Verify a domain in the Resend dashboard

Change EMAIL_FROM to use that domain (e.g., hello@yourdomain.com)

The contact endpoint lives at app/api/contact/route.ts.

🛠️ Customizing Content
Name/brand (header) → components/navigation.tsx

Home + About text → app/page.tsx and app/about/page.tsx

Experience timeline → app/experience/page.tsx (reads from lib/content.ts)

Skills/Expertise chips → arrays in lib/content.ts

Projects list → add/update in lib/content.ts

Adding a Project
Add an entry to the projects array in lib/content.ts:

ts
Copy code
{
  slug: "portfolio-website",
  title: "Portfolio Website",
  description: "A modern portfolio showcasing projects and experience.",
  longDescription:
    "Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui. Includes dynamic project pages and a Resend-powered contact form.",
  image: "/images/modern-portfolio-website.png",
  technologies: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "shadcn/ui"],
  category: "Website",
  featured: true,
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/yourname/portfolio",
  liveUrl: "https://your-portfolio.vercel.app",
  completedAt: "2025-09-01"
}
Pages under /projects/[slug] are statically generated by generateStaticParams using the slug values.

📨 Contact Form (Resend)
UI: app/contact/page.tsx

API: app/api/contact/route.ts

Validates payload

Sends email via Resend

Responds with JSON

Testing tips

Keep EMAIL_TO set to your own address while testing (required on free Resend accounts).

If you see a 403 like “You can only send testing emails to your own email address…”, verify a domain in Resend and update EMAIL_FROM.

Anti-spam ideas (optional)

Add a hidden honeypot input

Rate-limit the route

Use simple server-side validation (already included)

🔎 Notes on Next.js 15 Dynamic Params
In Next 15, route params are async. Example:

ts
Copy code
export default async function ProjectPage({
  params,
}: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}

export async function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
Apply the same pattern anywhere you read dynamic params.

☁️ Deployment (Vercel)
Push the repo to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket)

Import the project into Vercel

Add Environment Variables in Vercel:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL

RESEND_API_KEY

EMAIL_TO

EMAIL_FROM

Deploy 🎉

🧩 Troubleshooting
Node version: ensure Node ≥ 20.19. Some packages warn on older minors.

Emails not received:

Check Resend dashboard logs

On free tier, send to your own email or verify a domain

Confirm EMAIL_FROM uses your verified domain

Check spam/junk and allow time for first-time domain warmup

Styling not applied:

Make sure Tailwind is loaded via styles/globals.css

Restart the dev server after editing Tailwind config/content

Dynamic routes 404:

Confirm the slug exists in lib/content.ts

Rebuild after adding new slugs

🤝 Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome.
If you add features, try to keep the codebase consistent with the current stack (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui).
